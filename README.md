# Classification with SVM
Classify ancient cursive Japanese (Kuzushiji )writing


Use Support Vector Machines (SVM)

# The KMNIST Dataset
10 classes corresponding to 10 different characters


70’000 samples (7’000 foreach class)


Divided into 60’000 for training and 10’000 for testing


Recent deep learning schemes can reach an accuracy of 99%


Expect an accuracy around 80% for a «baseline» SVM classification
